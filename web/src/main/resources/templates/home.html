<p>How we might organise things here: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage Models: pull, delete, manage models available at ollama...</li>
    <li>Manage Agents: be able to search them, create new ones, delete, snapshot them, ask them things...</li>
    <li>Manage Workspaces: We might want to copy snapshots of agents so that they don't know about other projects</li>
</ul>
